| Installation guide for nightVM |
+--------------------------------+

Check ./src/ for the source of nightVM. It is assumed that, during translation, a preprocessing directive of the form

# include "q-char-sequence" new-line

searches for the named source file the way it is defined in SUSv4-2018 4.13 (Pathname resolution).

NightVM does not exactly conform to the ISO/IEC 2899:2011 standard. Even though most of the code is conforming, the behavior of some constructs depend on guarantees provided by SUSv4-2018.

To get nightVM working, just translate ./src/libnightVM.c and ./src/nightVM.c, and link them.
