| Translation guide for nightVM |
+-------------------------------+

Check ./src/ for the source of nightVM. It is assumed that, during translation, a preprocessing directive of the form
# include "q-char-sequence" new-line
searches for the named source file the way it is defined in SUSv4-2018 4.13 (Pathname resolution).

NightVM does not exactly conform to the ISO/IEC 2899:2011 standard. Even though most of it is conforming, the behavior of some constructs depend on guarantees provided by SUSv4-2018. It, however, does indeed conform to XSI, but it might not exactly be strictly conforming, because chances are, certain implementation limits have been exceeded (though I have not verified that yet).

To get nightVM working, just translate ./src/libnightVM.c and ./src/nightVM.c, and link them.

| Translating the easier way |
+----------------------------+

If you're using a SUSv4-2018 compliant system and are fine with toc and the implementation of the standard library being put in /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/lib/ respectively, you can check out the TRANSLATE_DEF file for instructions. The instructions are guaranteed to work for clang 14.0.0 and gcc 11.4.0; however, for other implementations, the commands may or may not work the way they're meant to, depending on how certain arugments are parsed/interpreted.
